                "I've seen the world, done it all, had my cake now,<br>
                Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now.<br>
                Hot summer nights, mid-July,<br>
                When you and I were forever wild,<br>
                The crazy days, city lights,<br>
                The way you'd play with me like a child."

                I know you will, I know you will,<br>
                I know that you will."

                Channeling angels in a new age now.<br>
                Hot summer days, rock and roll,<br>
                The way you'd play for me at your show.<br>
                And all the ways I got to know<br>
                Your pretty face and electric soul."

                When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in.<br>
                Father, tell me if you can."
